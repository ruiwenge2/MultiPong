MultiPong - A multiplayer pong game (and its my birthday today :D)

Hey guys! Today is my birthday (wow the same month as @CodingCactus, @Coder100, and @PixiGem), and I made a multiplayer pong game where you can either play against another person online or against the computer! Here are the features:

- See your opponent's moves
- Play against the computer
- Inviting people to a room

Remember, you are always on the right side, and your opponent is always on the left side. To move your paddle, use the up and down arrow keys. The first player to ten points wins! See more details on how to play at https://multipong.ruiwenge2.repl.co/howtoplay.
